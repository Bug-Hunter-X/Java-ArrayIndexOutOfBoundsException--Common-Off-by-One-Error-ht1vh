# Java ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Off-by-One Error

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java that leads to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The code attempts to iterate through an array, but the loop condition incorrectly includes the last index, resulting in an out-of-bounds exception.

The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.java` file provides the corrected version with a proper loop condition.

This example highlights the importance of careful loop index management when working with arrays in Java.
